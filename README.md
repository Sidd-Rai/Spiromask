For my mini project, I conducted a breathing analysis by recording my breath using the built-in microphone of my wired earphones connected to my laptop. I utilized the laptop's voice recorder to capture the audio.

After that, I imported the recording into Adobe Premiere Pro for further processing. I used three audio effects to enhance the clarity of the breathing patterns and to suppress any undesirable background noise. These three audio effects are as follows:

1. A low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 800Hz was utilized to eliminate whirring sounds caused by air hitting the microphone casing.

2. A high-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 20Hz was implemented to remove inaudible background noises from nearby sources like clocks and other electronics.

3. A +5dB audio boost in both channels to make the audio louder and easier to analyze.

Then I exported the file as an .mp3 file, under the name "Breathing_edited.mp3."

The cumulative effect of these adjustments resulted in an audio recording that facilitates a clear and precise analysis of breathing patterns.

The original breathing sound was recorded under the name "Breathing_Unedited.m4a."

Please refer to the attached audio files for experiencing the difference after processing.

Further Improvements:
We can further process and reduce these breathing sounds into "breathing patterns," which can be represented using integer or float values. This will make it very easy to process everything on a microprocessor and to report the findings to us through the network.
